# Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe

This Python application provides users with an AI opponent that plays Tic Tac Toe with perfect strategy. It uses a minimax algorithm to solve for the "best worst-case" scenario for each possible move to be taken. In any game, regardless of who goes first or which space is initially chosen, the opponent will not achieve worse than a tie. It uses Pygame to draw to the screen in the runner.py file and separate functions for logic in the tictactoe.py file.
